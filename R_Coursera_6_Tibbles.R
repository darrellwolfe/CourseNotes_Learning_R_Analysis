# You can load the dataset with the data() function using the following code:
  
library(tidyverse) 

data(diamonds)

# Then, let’s add the data frame to our data viewer in RStudio with the View() function. 

View(diamonds)

# Now let’s create a tibble from the same dataset. You can create a tibble from existing data with the as_tibble() function. Indicate what data you’d like to use in the parentheses of the function. In this case, you will put the word “diamonds."

as_tibble(diamonds)

  Overview
A tibble, or tbl_df, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don’t change variable names or types, and don’t do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. Tibbles also have an enhanced print() method which makes them easier to use with large datasets containing complex objects.

If you are new to tibbles, the best place to start is the tibbles chapter in R for data science.

Installation
# The easiest way to get tibble is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just tibble:
install.packages("tibble")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tibble")
Usage
library(tibble)
Create a tibble from an existing object with as_tibble():
  
  data <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = letters[1:3], c = Sys.Date() - 1:3)
data
#>   a b          c
#> 1 1 a 2023-02-21
#> 2 2 b 2023-02-20
#> 3 3 c 2023-02-19

as_tibble(data)
#> # A tibble: 3 × 3
#>       a b     c         
#>   <int> <chr> <date>    
#> 1     1 a     2023-02-21
#> 2     2 b     2023-02-20
#> 3     3 c     2023-02-19
This will work for reasonable inputs that are already data.frames, lists, matrices, or tables.

You can also create a new tibble from column vectors with tibble():
  
  tibble(x = 1:5, y = 1, z = x^2 + y)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 3
#>       x     y     z
#>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1     1     1     2
#> 2     2     1     5
#> 3     3     1    10
#> 4     4     1    17
#> 5     5     1    26

tibble() does much less than data.frame(): it never changes the type of the inputs (e.g. it keeps list columns unchanged, and never converts strings to factors!), it never changes the names of variables, it only recycles inputs of length 1, and it never creates row.names(). You can read more about these features in vignette("tibble").

You can define a tibble row-by-row with tribble():
  
  tribble(
    ~x, ~y,  ~z,
    "a", 2,  3.6,
    "b", 1,  8.5
  )
#> # A tibble: 2 × 3
#>   x         y     z
#>   <chr> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 a         2   3.6
#> 2 b         1   8.5

The tibble print method draws inspiration from data.table, and frame. Like data.table::data.table(), tibble() doesn’t change column names and doesn’t use rownames.
