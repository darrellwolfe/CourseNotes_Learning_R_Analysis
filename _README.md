# R_Analysis GitHub CodeBase

```{r echo = TRUE}
print("Hello, World!") # Welcome to my corner of the digi-verse.
```

This is my CodeBase for working in R for Data Analysis. I started this repository while working on learning R. While individual projects may be private (and therefore not in this CodeBase) I intend on using this repo for all my R learning needs. As I learn, I will be compiling helpful resources and compiling the basics in this repo.

Start with my LearnR_UserGuide which I will be adding to frequently as I work through learning the ropes.

Shalom,

Darrell Wolfe
