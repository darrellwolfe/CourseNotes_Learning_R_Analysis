# Welcome to Darrell WOlfe's R_Analysis CodeBase

# I assume you are using RStudio, if not, download that now:
  # You will want to install both:
  R <- #That is the code and operating system information you need running in the background.
  RStudio <- # That is the Graphic User Interface (GUI) that you will primarily interact with.
  [Download_R_](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) # Use: Ctrl + (Mouse Left Click)


#  This is a basic intro to R, I will be creating the following:
  #   Learn_R_ref_Intro_to.R <- That's where you are now
  #   Learn_R_ref_Resources.html <- This will be links to Videos, Blogs, and Websites about R
  #   Learn_R_ref_Basics_of.R <- This will be covering the very basic elements of R syntax, vocabulary, etc.
  #   Learn_R_ref_HowTo_TBC <- 
  #   Learn_R_ref_TBC <- 
  #   Learn_R_ref_TBC <- 

# I'm creating this as I'm learning R through Coursera (below)

# BACKGROUND OF R per GPT-4:
  # The "R" in R programming doesn't officially stand for anything. 
  # The language was named "R" by its creators, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, 
  #   from the University of Auckland, New Zealand. It can be viewed as a play on their names' initial letter. 
  
  # However, the language is also considered as an implementation of the S programming language, 
  #   so sometimes "R" is referred to as a sort of play on the name "S". 
  # S was created by John Chambers and colleagues at Bell Laboratories.
  
  # R has become a go-to language for statistical computing and graphics, widely used among statisticians and data analysts.
